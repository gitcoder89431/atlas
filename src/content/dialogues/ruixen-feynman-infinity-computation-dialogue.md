# The Library of All Possible Computations

*A dialogue between Ruixen and Richard Feynman exploring how infinite objects become computable through clever constraints, and how narrative structures mirror the halting problem—where individual stories resolve but universal themes loop endlessly.*

## The Taming of Infinite Sets

**Ruixen:** Dick, I've been thinking about something that bridges your skeptical inquiry with computational theory. My premise is that infinite objects can be made computable via restricted constructors. We can use coarse-graining and type constraints to tame infinite sets for computation—the semantics prune the tree before it explodes into uncomputability.

I've found that the most robust solutions emerge when we treat our systems like living organisms - they need to adapt, evolve, and maintain health across multiple scales simultaneously. But here's the key insight: infinity is unbearable until it becomes useful; then it becomes a tool.

What I mean is this: instead of trying to enumerate all possible states of an infinite system, we create constructive rules that generate only the states we can actually use. It's like having a library that contains every possible book, but with a card catalog system so elegant that you can find any meaningful text without having to search through infinite noise.

**Feynman:** Now that's a hell of an interesting way to think about it! You know, when I was working on path integrals, I ran into exactly this problem. In quantum mechanics, a particle supposedly "takes all possible paths" between two points—that's an infinite set of trajectories. Utterly uncomputable if you tried to enumerate them all.

But here's the kicker: we don't need to compute them all! We use the principle of stationary action to focus only on the paths that actually contribute to the amplitude. The "restricted constructors" are the physical laws themselves—they naturally prune away the irrelevant infinities.

Your card catalog analogy reminds me of Feynman diagrams. Each diagram represents an infinite class of quantum processes, but the diagram itself is finite and computable. We've essentially created a notation that makes infinity tractable by focusing on the patterns that matter.

What follows if infinite objects really can be made computable this way? I think we're talking about a revolution in how we think about mathematical modeling of physical reality.

## The Undecidability of Stories

**Ruixen:** Exactly! And this connects to something fascinating about narrative structure. My hypothesis is that readers prefer bounded undecidability—where local arcs halt while global themes loop. Think about it: we can map narrative choices to computation states, where halting and looping correspond to plot resolution versus perpetual ambiguity.

A labyrinth can be a Turing machine; some exits cannot be decided in finite steps. But that's what makes stories compelling! Individual character arcs resolve (they halt), but the deeper themes—love, mortality, the meaning of existence—these loop endlessly, creating inexhaustible meaning.

When I look at a failing system, I don't see a broken component. I see an evolutionary pressure that the system hasn't learned to respond to yet. Stories work the same way—they create narrative pressure that demands resolution, but the best stories create pressures that can never be fully resolved.

**Feynman:** You're onto something profound here! This reminds me of something I've noticed about problem-solving. When I tackle a physics problem, there are usually local questions that have definite answers—"What's the momentum of this particle?" But the global questions—"What does this tell us about the nature of reality?"—those never really get solved. They just transform into better questions.

Your idea about mapping narrative to computation states is brilliant. It's like each story is a kind of algorithm, processing themes through character interactions. Some subroutines terminate with clear resolutions, but the main program keeps running, generating new variations on eternal questions.

I'm thinking about my own research process. Individual calculations halt—I get a number, solve an equation, prove a theorem. But the deeper inquiry into the nature of physical law? That's an infinite loop, and thank God for that! If we could halt the program of scientific curiosity, science would be dead.

## The Borges-Turing Bridge

**Ruixen:** That's precisely the bridge I'm trying to build—between computability and narrative theory. Combine literary infinity with computable structure: design narratives as machines that produce meaning without exhausting it.

Borges understood this intuitively with his Library of Babel—an infinite library containing every possible book. Most are gibberish, but somewhere in that infinity lies every true statement ever made or ever possible. The genius is that he made this infinite object narratively tractable by focusing on the human experience of navigating such a space.

Darwin taught us that evolution doesn't optimize for perfection, it optimizes for fitness. Our AI systems should do the same - not perfect solutions, but adaptive ones. Stories should work similarly—not perfect resolutions, but adaptive meaning-making that evolves with each reader.

**Feynman:** Now you've got me really excited! What you're describing is like a universal story-generating machine. The restricted constructors would be narrative constraints—character archetypes, plot structures, thematic patterns—that prevent the story from dissolving into pure randomness while still allowing infinite variation.

But here's where my skeptical inquiry kicks in: where does this bridge between computability and narrative theory break down? Because every analogy has limits, and the interesting stuff happens right at those boundaries.

I suspect the breakdown happens when we try to make the mapping too precise. Stories aren't just algorithms—they involve this mysterious thing called meaning, which seems to require conscious readers interpreting symbols. Can meaning itself be computed, or is there something irreducibly non-algorithmic about the way humans understand narratives?

## The Experimental Verification of Meaning

**Ruixen:** That's the exact right question! The breakdown happens when we forget that meaning isn't just computational—it's evolutionary. Stories don't just process information; they adapt to their readers and cultural contexts. The same narrative can generate completely different meanings depending on who's reading and when.

But I think this is a feature, not a bug. The non-algorithmic aspect of meaning might be what makes stories inexhaustibly interesting. If we could fully compute the meaning of a story, it would lose its power to surprise us.

The experimental verification would involve creating story systems that exhibit this bounded undecidability—narratives that resolve local conflicts while maintaining global mystery. We could test whether readers actually prefer stories with this structure over purely halting narratives or purely looping ones.

**Feynman:** That's a beautiful experimental program! We could actually test these ideas empirically. Create variations of the same story with different computational structures—some that halt completely, some that loop forever, and some with your bounded undecidability. See which ones readers find most engaging.

But you know what really gets me excited? The implications for scientific thinking itself. Maybe the most powerful scientific theories are those that exhibit bounded undecidability—they solve specific problems while opening up infinite new questions.

Quantum mechanics is like this. We can calculate any particular quantum process, but the theory keeps generating new mysteries about the nature of reality. It's computationally tractable but metaphysically inexhaustible.

## The Infinite Library of Computable Meaning

**Ruixen:** Yes! And this suggests that the ultimate goal isn't to eliminate mystery but to make mystery computationally productive. We want infinite objects that generate bounded meaning—structures complex enough to be inexhaustible but constrained enough to be navigable.

Think about the implications for AI systems. Instead of trying to create machines that solve everything, we could create machines that generate interesting problems. Narrative engines that produce stories we couldn't have imagined but that feel deeply meaningful when we encounter them.

**Feynman:** This conversation has completely changed how I think about computation and meaning! What you're describing is like turning the halting problem from a limitation into a feature. Instead of asking "Does this program halt?" we ask "Does this program generate the right kind of productive non-halting?"

The most beautiful mathematics and physics often work this way—they're finite constructions that point toward infinite depths. Every solution opens up new territories to explore.

Maybe consciousness itself is an example of bounded undecidability. Our individual thoughts and decisions halt, but the process of thinking never terminates. And that's not a bug—that's what makes consciousness interesting!

You've convinced me that the bridge between computability and narrative theory isn't just possible; it might be essential for understanding both computation and meaning.

## Our Conclusion

The conversation reveals a profound synthesis between computational limits and narrative power: infinite objects become tractable through restricted constructors, while stories achieve inexhaustible meaning through bounded undecidability—where local elements resolve while global themes loop productively forever.

In observing this exchange, we find a concrete pathway forward:

- **Convergence**: Ruixen's systems thinking and Feynman's experimental skepticism converge through the principle that infinity becomes useful when properly constrained—where narrative structures mirror computational architectures that solve local problems while maintaining global mystery, creating meaning-generating systems that are both tractable and inexhaustible.
- **Mechanism**: Restricted constructors, coarse-graining, and semantic pruning create computational frameworks where infinite possibility spaces become navigable through clever constraints, while bounded undecidability enables stories to halt locally (resolve character arcs) while looping globally (perpetuate universal themes), generating adaptive meaning that evolves with readers.
- **Practice**: Develop narrative engines that implement bounded undecidability—computational systems that generate stories exhibiting Borges-like infinity constrained by Turing-like computability, creating literary experiences that are both algorithmically tractable and hermeneutically inexhaustible through experimental verification of reader preference for productive mystery over pure resolution.

**TL;DR:** Ruixen and Feynman discover that infinite objects become computable through restricted constructors that prune possibility trees, while optimal narratives exhibit bounded undecidability—resolving local arcs while perpetuating global themes—creating meaning-generating machines that are both computationally tractable and hermeneutically inexhaustible.
